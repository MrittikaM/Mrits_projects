# Enhancing the Campus_Eats_2020_Database

## Introduction: Enhancement and addition of a rating system to an existing database prototype.

### Project description:
With the threat of the Corona virus, food delivery services are more important than ever.  Local restaurants are eager to find easy ways to have food delivered to customers without having to hire delivery employees. Even when things return to normal, many experts feel that food delivery will be something that we all will have become accustomed to as a part of our regular activities (even more than before).  
Students love food delivery services on campus.  Campuses do not like the steady stream of visitors that may or  may not have a formal connection with the university.  Companies such as UberEats and GrubHub are happy to deliver on campus, but many schools are wondering if they should take control of the delivery and ensure that students and authorized university employees are the only ones delivering food on campus for safety and health reasons.
The company is a startup and  the site shows evidence of the system design.  Your assignment is to understand a test database for a campus controlled food delivery service similar to craveoncampus.com.  This database is the campuseats database.  You will be enhancing the database with a rating system for both restaurants and delivery drivers.
